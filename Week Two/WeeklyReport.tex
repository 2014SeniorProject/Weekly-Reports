\section{Group Time Synopsis}
	\subsection{Team efforts and overall status}
	{\bfseries Current Group Leader:} Ben Smith
	\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} interaction with the instructors was useful in the second week. They allowed 
	the group to narrow our focus in both societal problem and design feature set. The societal problem 
	of health and wellness is adversely affected by the level of physical activity within the society. 
	We are delivering an engineering solution that addresses inactivity as a particular cause to 
	societal health and wellness.  The narrowed focus allowed a more concrete feature set to be 
	developed in this weekâ€™s assignment. The development of this engineering specification went much 
	more smoothly than the problem statement. Everyone will be relieved to finalize the technical 
	feature set this upcoming week.

	\subsection{Presentation review and problem statement editing}
				Before the class meeting we finalized our project statement document and submited it into 
    			the Hive. We also decided on what we need to have in our presentation and finished our Power
                point Presentation. We then distributed the work amongst the group members are practiced
                the presentation.
                
	\subsection{The "Tatroing" debreif}
		        The group was advised that inactivity is not a societal problem. Inactivity does effect a
                socities overall health and wellness.
                
	\subsection{Belkoushe Q \& A}
                Belkoushe was kind enough to meet with our group on thursday morning to discuss our project's
                direction. We were able to get a better idea of the requirements. We finished the meeting
                by discussing our new direction and making sure each member knew what they had to do.
                
	\subsection{Design document first draft}
                We had a voice conference over the internet to collaberate our ideas for the feature set of our
                system. We also discussed and layed out the outline for the Design Document and assigned sections
                for every one to work on. 
	
	\subsection{Design document beta typesetting}
                Sunday night we were able to compile the majority of the document into \LaTeX and discuss further
                work required. This ensured that our templates are working correctly and we can continue with the
                document.
	
	\subsection{Weekly planning and review }
                We got together in the morning to check up on every one's progress, and discussed the required tasks
                for the upcoming week. Together we decided on each member's responsibilities and the time required
                for this next stage.

	\subsubsection*{Synopsis of past week's work}
        I spent a large amount of time going over existing designs of ebikes. I then started researching into motor options, 
        which has proven to be a more difficult task than anticipated. Difficulties include chosing between internally geared 
        or direct drive hub motors, as well as power requirements. I contributed to our Design Document as well.

\subsection{David Larribas}

	\subsubsection*{Synopsis of past week's work}

	The main goal of this week was to find our focus in the societal problem and design. I spent a large portion
    of the beginning of the week in discussion with the group and instructors. During this time, I researched
    various pre-existing designs that solved the problem. After this I narrowed my focus to the lighting system. 
    I researched lighting solutions that have already been implemented and looked at the reviews to determine which 
    products were performing the best and why. I also looked into selecting parts for the lighting units and which
    motor/battery/controller system to use.

	\subsubsection*{Special Problems or other reporting}
    Predicting hours seems to be a problem as we are usually underestimating the time it takes us to complete tasks. I have been lucky so far as I have not had much strain from other sources, but in the future I will need to allocate time more efficiently.

	\subsubsection*{Synopsis of past week's work}

	The beginning of the week consisted of researching and discussing possible features for the system. 
	Once they had been compiled we broke them up into groups to research and report the various
	aspects of each feature including why it is relevant, what has been done before, how it would be
	implemented, and resources needed. After we had finished, we began typesetting the document in \LaTeX
	and refining our desired layout. There was a substantial amount of discusion on required features and 
    possible parts to order.

\subsection{Ben Smith}

	\subsubsection*{Synopsis of past week's work}
	This week consisted of technical research. Pace accelerated once we had features to investigate.
	The majority of my research went into control systems and the feasability of using heartrate as a
    control mechanism. There are interesting models that have been developed with quality documentation.
    One particular IEEE article used a Hammerstein model to control the speed of a treadmill based on
    heartrate of the user. This control system showed much better control of a heartrate than a PID
    based control system.
